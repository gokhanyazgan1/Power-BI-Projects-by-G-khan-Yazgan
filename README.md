Project for the Improvement of Occupational Accident Statistics

This project, titled Project for the Improvement of Occupational Accident Statistics, aims to assess and improve the availability and quality of occupational accident statistics in Turkey, and to facilitate the transmission of data to Eurostat. The project evaluates the alignment of data compiled by the Social Security Institution (SGK) with the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology.

Content
This document explains the compilation of occupational accident statistics, the ESAW methodology, and the legal framework within the European Union. Additionally, it provides detailed information on the dataset used, ESAW variables, and the core characteristics of occupational accidents.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enhance the quality of occupational accident data in Turkey, ensure the provision of data to Eurostat, and identify the necessary steps to align this data with international standards. To facilitate real-time analysis and collaboration among stakeholders, a Power BI application has been developed and integrated as part of this initiative.

Occupational accident statistics in Turkey are compiled by the Social Security Institution (SGK) through the "Occupational Accident and Occupational Disease Notification" (Annex 1). The collected data is aggregated annually and published on the SGK website as Statistical Yearbooks.

The Project for the Improvement of Occupational Accident Statistics was initiated following the approval by the Presidency of the Turkish Statistical Institute on April 15, 2022 (No. 32485). The project's goals are to assess the availability and quality of existing occupational accident statistics and to facilitate the transmission of data to Eurostat.

On June 14, 2022, a meeting was held at the SGK Actuary and Fund Management Department, with the participation of the Social Statistics Department of the Turkish Statistical Institute. The meeting focused on assessing the current situation, sharing the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology, and planning the necessary steps to ensure compliance with Eurostat requirements. During the meeting, it was decided to acquire accident data, assess the quality and completeness of variables, and establish protocols between institutions for data exchange.

Data from SGK for the years 2016-2021 was requested through the Data Collection and Coordination Department. This data was analyzed with reference to the "European Statistics on Accidents at Work - Summary Methodology 2012" (Annex 3) and the "Guidelines for ESAW Data Transmission 2020 Edition v1.5" (Annex 4). The comparison of existing variables and the necessary variables for data transmission to Eurostat was conducted in accordance with these guidelines. The required data patterns, deviations from the ideal state observed in the database, and the categorical variable lists needed for alignment were presented in Annex 5.
